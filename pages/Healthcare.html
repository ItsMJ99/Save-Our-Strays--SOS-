                            Upon arrival at our facility,
                            each animal undergoes a thorough health examination by a licensed veterinarian. This initial
                            assessment
                            helps us identify any immediate medical needs and create tailored treatment plans.

                            Regular veterinary check-ups are an integral part of our commitment to their well-being.
                            These check-ups
                            include vaccinations, dental care, and routine wellness exams. We believe that preventative
                            care is key
                            to maintaining the health of our rescued animals. Any medical issues or injuries that arise
                            are promptly
                            addressed with the appropriate treatments and medications, ensuring that our animals receive
                            the best
                            care possible.</p>

                            Donations play a crucial role in maintaining our dedicated medical fund, which covers a wide

                            essential expenses. These contributions directly impact the lives of the animals in our
                            care, allowing us to
                            provide medical attention when it's needed most.

                            The medical fund supports various aspects of healthcare, including surgeries, medications,
                            emergency
                            treatments, and ongoing medical care. For example, surgeries may be necessary to address
                            injuries or
                            conditions that require surgical intervention. Medications are provided to manage chronic
                            health issues and
                            to ensure the comfort of our animals. Emergency treatments are available for unexpected
